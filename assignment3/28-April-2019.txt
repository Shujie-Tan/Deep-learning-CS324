Today the lab is not linked to any new assignment. Instead you can keep working on the previous assignment and also play around with variational autoencoders.

In particular, I encourage you to read through the code here and test this variational autoencoder on the MNIST dataset:
https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/vae/main.py
You should be able to recognise the elements with studied in todayâ€™s lecture when looking at the code in this github repository.

See also the appendix (particularly B and C) of this paper to understand the implementation details:
